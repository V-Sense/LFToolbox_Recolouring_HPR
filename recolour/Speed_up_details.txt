To speed up processing time we made some optimisation changes as follows:

1. When processing each image in the light field, we passed the set of parameters that were used to recolour its neighbour to the optimisation step as initial parameters.
This ensures that a good initial guess for the new parameters is given at the beginning of the optimisation.

2. We added a two step optimisation process :
 - the first uses a small sample of the correspondences to get a rough estimate of the parameters. We limit the number of iterations in this case to make sure it is fast. 
 - the second refines the parameter estimation using all of the correspondences. We allow this step to run until convergence to ensure that our algorithm remains accurate. We do not re-estimate the affine parameters in this step as we found that these parameters are accurate enough after the first 'rough' estimation step.
