# Light Field toolbox - Recolouring step

This code is mostly meant to correct colour inconsistencies in Light Field datasets taken using plenoptic cameras [1].
This will allow you to propagate the colours from the centre of a Light Field to all the images, which will ensure you get consistent sub-aperture images accross the whole set.

For additional details and visual results, see [our webpage](https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/research/light-fields/a-pipeline-for-lenslet-light-field-quality-enhancement/).

The additional post-processing steps presented in [1] (RAW data demultiplexing and denoising) are not present in this repository.
You can find them respectively [here](https://github.com/V-Sense/LFToolbox-CLIM_VSENSE) and [here](https://github.com/V-Sense/LFBM5D).

The proper order in which to use these tools is : RAW data demultiplexing --> Recolouring --> Denoising.

# Usage

For simplicity's sake, we made it so that you only have to use the one file, everything else is done automatically :
- put any number of datasets in the folder called "data"
- at the beginning of the file "recolour_centre_neighbour.m", add/replace the paths to your datasets, assuming that the root folder is ".../data/"
- launch the code by calling "recolour_centre_neighbour.m" ; no arguments are necessary.
